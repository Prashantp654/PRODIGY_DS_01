# Prodigy Infotech Internship Task 1
Problem Statement :- Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

My internship kicked off with the task of creating a Bar Chart or Histogram to visualize population distribution. It may sound simple, but this was my first real foray into data visualization. I had to carefully select the right data, choose the most appropriate chart type, and ensure that the visualization was both informative and visually appealing. This project allowed me to grasp the importance of data visualization in conveying insights effectively.
